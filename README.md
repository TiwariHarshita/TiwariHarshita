## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 Myself Harshita Tiwari. I am an upcoming 2nd year college student persuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication engineering from LNMIIT,JAIPUR,INDIA.
 I am a learner and love to create tech-y solutions to real world problems. I am driven by my love for computers and the world of communication and I'm always looking for paths that connect these two.
 I like photography when I am not a tehc enthusiast but I am an all time art enthusiast :)
 Community is a very important part of my life and I believe the best things come through collaborations, and maybe the next best thing is waiting for ours:)
 A little technology information about me-

- âš¡ Fun fact: I can make anything into a rhyme at the drop of a hat
                 and because you're still reading i wonder if you're sat
                  a million different books i read, but i love the one with a rat
                   and when a ball is caught in cricket, we say how's THAT:)
