## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 Myself Harshita Tiwari. I am a 3rd year college student persuing B.Tech in Electronics and Communication engineering from LNMIIT,JAIPUR,INDIA.
 I am a learner and love to create tech-y solutions to real world problems. I am driven by my love for computers and the world of communication and I'm always looking for paths that connect these two.

 Community is a very important part of my life and I believe the best things come through collaborations, and maybe the next best thing is waiting for ours:)
